## Integrating with Azure Machine Learning Studio

Machine learning (ML) is limited by the quality and amount of relevant data readily available for modelling and scoring.  The required data preparation effort is time consuming and expensive, quickly consuming allocated project resources. Not having enough data, not having the right data or even having too much of the wrong data is proven to be a significant barrier to delivering tangible business value when adopting of ML.

Sesam’s unique data driven architecture enables the rapid uptake of ML in the organization by quickly and simply facilitating the required data and systems integrations.

Sesam provides operational patterns for both training and operating ML models. With the increased agility provided by Sesam’s in built tools, data from all your enterprise systems can be powerfully combined, shaped and transformed into rich contextual feature sets and quickly delivered to directly modelling and scoring algorithms. This reduces the time and complexity usually required to deliver relevant business value.

# Overview of the pattern
Sesam enables organisations to integrate systems using data driven architecture. The entity datasets created by this process are rich in context and contain both the state of an entity in each system, and a defined master record. The data is strongly namespaced yet schemaless so as to maintain the original state of the data entity along with the merged and shaped version. This setup lends itself very well to the requirements for both training and operationalizing Machine Learning.

Here we integrate Sesam with Azure Machine Learning Studio


1.	Sesam is able to powerfully merge, combine and clean data entities from all your enterprise systems. This creates powerful and reusable global datasets, with strong name spacing, management of context and mapping of ontologies.
2.	From these global datasets, ML feature sets can be defined, shaped, and transformed ready for consumption by training score models and ML algorithms within Azure Machine Learning Studio.
3.	Iterations of the ML feature sets are easy to create and recreate in Sesam, as requirements evolve whilst data scientists work on modelling tasks.
4.	Once an ML model has been created and tested, it can be loaded into Azure ML Webservices within the Azure Machine Learning Studio.
5.	Sesam pipes are configured to supply the same feature set data definition used by the training and scoring process to the operational webservice. This enables both the initial load across all existing data, and thereafter processing the incremental and ongoing additional additions and changes to that data set.
6.	The data results generated by the ML processing is returned to the datahub. It is both merged with the global dataset enriching the context, and also can be simply propagated further to any system within your enterprise.

# Training Data
A training data set can be provided by re-using a global dataset or perhaps combining some datasets. A Sesam pipe is setup to do shaping task, and is provided by a publisher endpoint to the machine learning system. In this example we use AMLS, and provide data to it using the CSV published endpoint.

Once we have the data sets inside AMLS, the work required to train the scoring models can be completed, tested and evaluated.

At this stage, usually some iterations are required both with the modelling and also with the training data feature sets. Using Sesam to provide the data enables easy continuous improvement of the dataset, and as it is defined in code it is easy to roll forward and back the changes made.

# Operationalising ML
Once the models are ready to be productionized, it is easy with Sesam to enable the pattern where data is sent to the AMLS webservice for processing, with the results placed back into the data hub.

Using the already defined pipe configuration from the training set, we can pipe both the initial load, and from then on the incremental changes to the AMLS web service, quickly and easily. As the global data sets usually merge all the data from each system pertaining to an entity, we use the same pattern with the results from the ML web service. This provides the mechanism and therefore the data flow to propagate and share out the results of ML out to all other systems that may possibly have use for it.
