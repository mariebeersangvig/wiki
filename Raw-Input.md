# Raw Input

When reading data into Sesam you can keep the data as is (raw input) or you could read a subset of the data or transform the data on the way in. By storing the raw data you try to keep the data as close to the original as possible (not always possible).

## Benefits
- Much easier to re-use the data
- No decisions has to be made before you import
- Import once and never touch it again

## Drawbacks
- Increased storage use if you don't need all the data
