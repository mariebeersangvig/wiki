# Community Wiki for Sesam

Sesam is an [extensible platform](https://docs.sesam.io/extension-points.html), and this wiki is for documenting everything that is not part of the official Sesam product. The wiki contains pages for different patterns, best practices and how to integrate with various services.

We're looking for more editors! Please contact one of the [current editors](https://github.com/orgs/sesam-community/people) if you want to help out.

Before adding a new page, check if there is a page that covers the subject already and help improve that page instead.

## Best practices
- [[TDD]]
- [[CircuitBreaker]]

## Patterns
